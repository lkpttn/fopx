Hello. I spend my time working at DoSomething.org with a healthy selection of side projects. A link to [Jekyll Now](http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/).
Iâ€™m interested in systems, games, consistency, empathy, subtlety and graceful complexity. You can find me on Twitter, Dribbble, and Instagram.
