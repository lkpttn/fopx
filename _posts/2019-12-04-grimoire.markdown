Grimoire is a React app built to help Dungeons & Dragons parties spend less time fiddling with numbers and more time playing. It functions as a suite of tools that make party life easier, like an initiative order tracker, game timer and more.

I originally made this app for my personal D&D group after completing a React training intensive. It's feature development is primarily driven by what I'm interested in, like `react-router` or other interesting libraries.
